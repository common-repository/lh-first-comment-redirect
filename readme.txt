== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH First Comment Redirect, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-first-comment-redirect/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-first-comment-redirect/) . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.

= Are there any other requirements?  =

This plugin relies on the [https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_body_open/](wp_body_open) hook. 98% of themes include it and it is now a standard. If yours does not, create a child theme, or get a better theme.

= What if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?  =
